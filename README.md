**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
The DriverPass project is the brainchild of our client to help users better pass their driver’s test. This client, Liam, saw that there was a need to better assist students pass their drivers test and wanted help designing a system that could support their users. The client wanted the user to be able to take tests to practice for the DOT exam and schedule drive times.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I feel like my business requirements document is especially well designed because I spent more time on it. My design document is a little rough because it was rough and is missing some elements.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
With the above being said, I would revise my design document, specifically my UML Class Diagram. I feel like all my diagrams were rough and rushed so there were crucial parts of each diagram missed, but the UML class diagram was most rushed. To better improve this diagram, I would first think of what each user needs to do and what attributes would be most useful. When I was designing my original document, I focused on the functions before finishing all my attributes. Another step that would improve this document would be working through each class and assigning proper functions that would benefit this system.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
In this system, we had an initial interview with the client to discuss the functionality requested and what we can do to help develop this system. If we had been doing this for real, I probably would have asked more questions to better understand the functionality that the client desired. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing the system, because they are the ones that are going to be using it most.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
The first thing to consider when designing software is what the client needs. This can be completed best in a meeting between yourself and the client as well as any other important individuals who will be responsible for upkeep of the system. Another option would be via email or written letter to get some of the functionality. This first step is not the only thing that should be done to analyze a system. You should also consider meeting with potential users or stakeholders of the project. One last strategy that can be used for analysis and design would be to research the topic or use your understanding of what similar software offers.
